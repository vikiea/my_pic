# 错误反馈
## 章鱼框架
- sql查询时select语句中只要有=就必须要做参数绑定，不合理
    ```sql
    SELECT uid,
        SUM(IF(balance_type=1,amount,0)) AS income,
        SUM(IF(balance_type=2,amount,0)) AS expenditure
        FROM pull_new_user_balance_detail
        GROUP BY uid
    ```
    
    执行会报错，而下面不会：
    ```sql
    SELECT id,uid,
        SUM(IF(balance_type=:type1,amount,0)) AS income,
        SUM(IF(balance_type=:type2,amount,0)) AS expenditure
        FROM pull_new_user_balance_detail
        GROUP BY uid
    ```
- Eloquent应该支持selectRow
